# bubi_prediction

The 'bubi_prediction' project was generated by using the default-python template.

## TODO

- Check why there is no data in the monitoring table
- Enable change data feed on monitoring table
- To ensure repeatability, add an end-date to the evaluation data as well, and always evaluate on the same time period.
- Add hyperparameter tuning.

## Target environment

Serverless environment version 3 <https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/release-notes/serverless/environment-version/three>

## Notes

The current logic is for a classical model, not for time series prediction. In this case, we should probably register a new model every day, and use that, no matter what. The fact that we registered a baseline model a long time ago should not mean that we don't overwrite that for example, because since then, we have a lot more data to train on.

I think this setup should be rewritten to use XGBoost for prediction with some features
